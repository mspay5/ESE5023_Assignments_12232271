## Comments for HW1 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignment ends up with a "101", "+1" is for your detailed comments and quotes from other students. Please try to use less _for_ loop to get the answer in Q3. Anyway, this is a good beginning! Keep going!

## Comments for HW2 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignment ends up with a "91", Including a "-2" for your missing of explaining any trend in Q1.2; a "-2" for your missing of explaining how you filter in Q2; a "-3" for reversing the `lat` and `lon` when you plot in Q3.4; a "-2 for your missing of pointing out which year stand out. Please pay more attention to the explaination request, keep going.

Here are some additional suggestions: Try not to show the reports with several warnings, which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings.
