## Comments for HW1 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignment ends up with a "101", "+1" is for your detailed comments and quotes from other students. Please try to use less _for_ loop to get the answer in Q3. Anyway, this is a good beginning! Keep going!

## Comments for HW2 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignment ends up with a "91", Including a "-2" for your missing of explaining any trend in Q1.2; a "-2" for your missing of explaining how you filter in Q2; a "-3" for reversing the `lat` and `lon` when you plot in Q3.4; a "-2 for your missing of pointing out which year stand out. Please pay more attention to the explaination request, keep going.

Here are some additional suggestions: Try not to show the reports with several warnings, which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings.

Wrong nino region, better to recheck. But right processing methods. (-1p)

Good job! I shall give you 30/30.
It would be better if you could add x label and y label in Q2 global/regional plot.

Good job! I shall give you 37/40.
Since you correctly calculated the CO2 trend with/without buffer effect correct, it would be better if you could reproduce Figure 2 in the article (-5). Your report is neat and organized (+2). Keep going!
